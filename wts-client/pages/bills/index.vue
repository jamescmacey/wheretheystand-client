                    <h4>Bills are proposed changes to the law, and must each pass through several stages in Parliament before becoming law.</h4>
                    <p>Before any bill becomes law, there are three main votes it must pass: these are the first, second and third readings. For most bills, there is a chance for members of the public to make submissions at the select committee stage, which happens between the first and second readings.</p><p>After a bill passes its third reading vote, it is granted Royal Assent by the Governor-General and becomes law, subject to any commencement provisions contained within the bill.</p>
                    <p>WhereTheyStand contains all bills from the 51st Parliament and later (2014â€”present). These are imported from Parliament's own website on a regular basis and are automatically linked with voting records and MPs' profiles to make it easier for you to find what you are looking for.</p>
